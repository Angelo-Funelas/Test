I created a website for distanced learning. This is just a concept, as of now students can only mark a classwork without uploading a file. In this website Teachers can create classrooms in which students can join in. Students in a classroom can be monitored by the teacher.

"school" is the app i created for this project. The static folder is where I placed files that i used to design my webpage. urls.py is the directory of urls i created for the app.

I believe my project satisfies the distinctiveness and complexity requirements because this was the first project wherein i learned how to be able to upload files to the website. I used multiple models most of which are correlated. This was also the first time i truly was able to make my website mobile-responsive. Using javascript i made my website more responsive and user friendly. and i used CSS to make my website appear better in mobile phone browsers. I also created my own APIs.

This project took me 2 months to create because my classes have started again, also because I wanted to polish and give this final project my all and apply all the lessons i learned. I am still figuring out how to improve my CSS and organize my code better. My code in this project is a little messy because i have a hard time keeping track of variables in CSS and Javascript that in the middle of me making this project, i decided I will place the styling and javascript in the html file itself.
